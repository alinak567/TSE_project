# TSE project

Our group project is dedicated to replicating the responses to monetary shocks as in Gertler & Karadi (2015) paper. The basic environment for the project is R, yet bonus parsing was prepared in Python.  All datasets used for project are uploaded on [disk](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/-DZIYqgbfbGTnA). 

The **report** contains the main results and graphs, and the `TSE_project.ipynb` you may find the replication code. Parsing for **bonus task** can be found in `Parsing.ipynb`
